A (very) rough implementation of Pong for Windows terminals.

Requirements: Windows 10+, Dotnet 8.

Controls: Q & A move player 1, Up and Down arrows move player 2. Esc to quit. First to 3 wins.

Known issues: The speed of the ball scales with the height and width of the window, but it does so poorly.
You want a relatively small, rectangular window for best results. \*cough\* Something like the vscode integrated terminal. \*cough\* There are probably bugs left in the collision calcs too.
